    "Multiprocessing in Python refers to the ability to run multiple processes simultaneously, combining multiple CPU cores for parallel execution. It's useful for improving performance and efficiency by distributing tasks across multiple processors, ideal for CPU-bound tasks. Unlike multithreading, multiprocessing allows true parallelism, avoiding Global Interpreter Lock limitations. With multiprocessing, Python can utilize the full power of modern multi-core systems, speeding up computation-intensive tasks such as data processing, scientific computing, and machine learning. It enhances scalability, responsiveness, and overall system throughput in Python applications."

    "True Parallelism: Utilizes multiple CPU cores effectively, allowing processes to run truly concurrently without being affected by the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL).\n",

    "Inter-Process Communication: Communication between processes is achieved through mechanisms like pipes, queues, and shared memory, facilitating data exchange.\n",

    "Shared Memory Space: Threads within the same process share memory space, allowing for efficient data sharing but increasing the complexity of synchronization.\n",

    "Limited Parallelism: Restricted by the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), limiting true parallelism and making multithreading more suitable for I/O-bound tasks than CPU-bound tasks.\n",
